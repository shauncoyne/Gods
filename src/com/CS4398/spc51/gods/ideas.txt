Gods.java should have a function that loops through all files to get information for all the believers on the server
When this function is called, it first writes all the believers to disk then reads the files then returns all the believer
objects in an arraylist. This is a temporary list.

Christian god with christian religion created by a Jesus sign. Very very war heavy, very expensive, but otherwise sucks

Satan god of christian religion that can cancel all Christian wars, super pacifist, no real powerful powers. Chill.

Scientology god created by tom cruze sign. Super wack, super weird. Made as a joke by the greek gods that fuels this nonexistant god.
